Today I began to seriously search for a large dataset to analyze. While I struggled to find the correct keywords for the search at first, I soon managed to find a dataset that perfectly fit my needs and was even compiled with my specific purpose in mind: https://www.kaggle.com/mfekadu/darpa-timit-acousticphonetic-continuous-speech. The ReadMe was extremely intriguing to read, as it joined both linguistics of American English dialects and discussed the several test/train splits the authors suggested. The dataset also contains a huge amount of data, which will afford me the opportunity to showcase my ability to clean and synthesize datasets. I also found a paper describing the analysis of audio using python, though I do not know how useful that will be until I dig into the dataset and its contents tomorrow.
