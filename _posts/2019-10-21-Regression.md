Title: Regression Project

My data was focused on soccer players and their stats from the FIFA 2019 database. As a result, it required extensive cleaning, as it contained columns with images (useless to data analysis). Many values, like height, weight, wage, and value of player also contained additional words like lbs (signifying pounds) or M (signifying millions) or K (signifying thousands) which the computer registered as strings rather than number, so I had to separate the integers from these words. After plotting several of the variables against each other, I found I had to log the value, wage, and international reputation of a player to even the distribution of these values. At this point I realized the value and wage of a player included several 0s, and I decided to drop these rows, as I had plenty of data and assumed that these 0s were used as placeholders rather than actually meaning the player made or was worth nothing. I had several categorical variables (Nationality, Club, Preferred Foot, Work Rate, and Position) which I changed into numerical variables using pd.get_dummies and amassed in one massive one_hot.

At this point, I had over 800 columns, making sns.pairplotting impossible. I decided to separate the columns by the level of correlation of the variable with the value of a player (calculated by R^2). Wage was correlated most highly with value of a player (R^2 = 0.85), followed by international reputation and overall ability and potential of a player.
