The results of the analysis of the rollercoaster data proved to be a lot less predictable than I originally assumed. I believed that as rollercoasters got younger (year built increased), their length and height would increase, as building materials have improved since the 1920s and interest has also grown largely since that time, inciting engineers to push the limits of structure and safety. Nevertheless, the graph of year built vs. height of rollercoaster showed a large clump between the years 1980 and 2020 with no obvious pattern. Some of the recent rollercoasters were actually lower than those built in the 1920s, though most were taller. While the range of modern rollercoastersâ€™ heights is certainly larger, this fact simply means that more rollercoasters exist now than before, rather than showing a relationship.
